1/ We built a JS framework for building AI chat bots that let users ask for what
they want instead of clicking in a GUI. The dream of a Language User Interface
(LUI) where all you need to do is ask and it happens is here! Video Demo: https://tella.tv/video/clima312q00gk0fl81qx8fjko/view…

Curious to hear how everyone is thinking about LLM memory. I’m focused on memory
meaning an LLM having an understanding of my previous interactions with it, not
in the vectorDB sense of providing context over information. From what I can
tell the available approaches are 1/n

An under rated and under explored benefit of AI chat systems is how easy it is
to make them collaborative. Fairly trivial to go from 1:1 chat to a group chat
with multiple people and the AI. It will be interesting to see how AI pushes new
software to be collaboration first.
